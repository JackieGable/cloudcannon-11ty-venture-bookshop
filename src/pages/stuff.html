      DeSet a main asset source on your site. By default this is your site
      files, which means that all assets uploaded or reference in your code are
      treated as relative to the root directory of your site files. Setting a
      DAM as your main asset source will disable use of your site assets, use
      your DAM as the assumed source of any relative asset URLs, and will begin
      saving relative URLs when you upload to that DAM in CloudCannon.scription
